    This class implements the LSH technique to efficiently find near-duplicate documents by hashing
    similar documents into the same buckets through MinHashing and banding techniques. It consists of
    the following key steps:
    
    - MinHash signatures computation: Shingle the documents and compute their MinHash signatures.
    - Banding: Split the MinHash signatures into bands and hash the bands to identify candidate pairs.
    - Duplicate detection: Detect exact duplicates and track them.
