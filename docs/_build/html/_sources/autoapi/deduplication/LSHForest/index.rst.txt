.. py:class:: LSHForest(num_hashes=200, num_bands=10, rows_per_band=4, num_trees=5, k=5)

   Bases: :py:obj:`deduplication.LSH.LSH`


   Locality Sensitive Hashing Forest using MinHash and Banding techniques.

   The LSHForest class extends the LSH class to support the creation of multiple
   trees in the forest, allowing for more robust detection of candidate pairs.
   Each tree corresponds to an independent LSH index, with results combined via majority voting.


   .. py:attribute:: num_trees

      Number of LSH trees in the forest.

      :type: num_trees (int)


   .. py:method:: banding(signatures)

      Performs the banding technique across multiple LSH trees and identifies candidate pairs.

      The signatures are split across multiple trees (LSH indices), and candidate pairs
      are identified within each tree using the banding technique. The candidate pairs
      from all trees are combined using a majority voting mechanism to form the final set
      of candidate pairs.

      :param signatures: A dictionary where keys are document IDs and values are MinHash signatures (lists of hash values).
      :type signatures: dict

      :returns: A set of candidate document pairs (as tuples of document IDs) that share similar bands.
      :rtype: set
