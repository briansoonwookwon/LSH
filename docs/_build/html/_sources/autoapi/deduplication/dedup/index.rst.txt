.. py:class:: Baseline

   .. py:attribute:: hash_set

      A set to store unique MD5 hashes of documents for deduplication.
      Used to track unique document hashes and identify duplicates in the dataset.


   .. py:method:: collection_deduplication(documents_dict)

      Groups documents into clusters based on identical content.

      :param documents_dict: Dictionary where keys are document IDs and values are document strings.

      :returns:

                Dictionary where each key is a cluster ID and the value is a list of document IDs
                        that are considered duplicates or similar.
      :rtype: clusters



   .. py:method:: detect_duplicates(documents)

      This function computes MD5 hashes of each document and identifies duplicates
      based on matching hash values.

      :param documents: list of document strings to check for duplicates.

      :returns: a set containing unique MD5 hashes of the documents.
                duplicates: a list of duplicate documents.
      :rtype: hash_set



   .. py:method:: length_based_baseline(documents)

      This function considers documents as duplicates if they have the same length.
      It compares the lengths of documents and identifies duplicates based on that.

      :param documents: list of document strings to check for duplicates.

      :returns: a dictionary that maps document lengths to documents.
                duplicates: a list of duplicate documents based on length.
      :rtype: length_map



   .. py:method:: tokenize(document)

      Tokenizes a document by splitting on spaces and returns a Counter of word frequencies.

      :param document: A string representing a document.

      :returns: A Counter object with word frequencies.



   .. py:method:: word_count_baseline(documents, threshold=0.8)

      This function uses word count similarity to find duplicates. If two documents have
      a word overlap greater than the threshold, they are considered duplicates.

      :param documents: A list of document strings.
      :param threshold: The fraction of word overlap required to consider two documents as duplicates.

      :returns: A list of tuples where each tuple contains two documents that are considered duplicates.
      :rtype: duplicates
